## Why is this topic worth researching?

Investigating innovative solutions for financing early-stage startups in Brazil is of fundamental importance, especially considering the structural barriers to capital access faced by these nascent companies and the relative weakness of the national venture capital environment compared to consolidated ecosystems such as Silicon Valley, London, and Tel Aviv [[1]](#ref1)[[2]](#ref2).

Since 2009, blockchain technology has consolidated itself as an emerging and constantly evolving infrastructure, with documented applications across multiple sectors, including finance, healthcare, Internet of Things (IoT), gaming, and supply chain management [[3]](#ref3). Currently, this technology processes assets in the order of trillions of dollars annually, and recent studies by McKinsey [[4]](#ref4) and BCG [[5]](#ref5) indicate a trend of expansion in the coming years.

In this context, this research aims to investigate possible applications of blockchain technology to the development of the Brazilian startup ecosystem, specifically regarding financing mechanisms, organizational structuring, and corporate governance. We chose to investigate the technical-operational and regulatory aspects related to issuing a cryptoasset designed to represent rights to dividends in early-stage startups.

The methodology comprises a conceptual and theoretical review of the technologies involved, analysis of the Brazilian and international regulatory landscape, an experimental issuance of a cryptoasset, implementation of a method for automated dividend distribution, and publication of the research artifacts and findings on GitHub under a free software license (GNU GPL v3).
